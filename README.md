🔍 Key Insights

Printers are the biggest success, generating the highest revenue and profit.

Accessories and Bookcases are weak performers and may need strategy review.

Some products sell in high quantities but have low profit margins.

Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh show the strongest state-level performance.

Cash on Delivery (COD) is the most preferred payment mode, indicating reliance on offline transactions.

A few top customers contribute most of the profit, while others add minimal value — useful for customer segmentation.
